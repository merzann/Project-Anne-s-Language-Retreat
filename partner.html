                <p>Second generation Skelligs' boat skipper, John O'Shea has the local islands in his
                    blood and he departs
                    daily for the Skelligs from Derrynane Harbour, a smuggling port used by the O'Connell clan of the
                    famous
                    Daniel 'The Liberator' O'Connell.</p>
                <p>The tour takes you past Deenish and Scariff Islands in the wildlife abundant Kenmare Bay and the
                    highlight of the trip is a 2.5 hours stopover on Skellig Michael - a 1,500-year-old monastic
                    settlement
                    which is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site.<br>On the return journey, you can take in close-up
                    views
                    of the Little Skellig, home to over 27,000 breeding pairs of gannets - making it the second largest
                    gannet colony in the world.<br>If you are lucky, we may be also be joined by curious dolphins on the
                    return
                    leg, while your skipper John O'Shea will often catch a few fish to cook and share on the voyage
                    home.
